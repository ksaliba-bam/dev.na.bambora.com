# Settlement Report

## Report Overview

As a Bambora Merchant, the Settlement Report provides an overview of
transactions and upcoming settlement disbursement. You will be able to view
pending settlement, settlement amount, when to expect it, and what fees were
removed. With the settlement data, you can spend less time on manual tasks and
reconciliation.

As a Bambora Partner, you can help your customers reconcile by
displaying settlement data within your software by using the Settlement Report.
It allows you to display to your customers their pending settlement, settlement
amount, when they can expect it, and what fees were removed. With the settlement
data, your customers can spend less time on manual tasks and reconciliation.

More detailed information about these fields can be found in our API specification
which can be found at: <https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/references/payment_APIs/v1-0-5/>

## Getting Started

The Settlement Report API is accessed via the URL
<https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/reports/settlement>

In addition you will need use your merchant ID and reporting API access
code from your Bambora account.  See the "Authentication" section below
for more details on how to generate the access passcode to use in the request
to the Settlement Report API.

## API Requests

### Request Headers

Requests to the settlement endpoint should include two request headers:
a `Content-type` header with the value `application/json` and a `Authorization`
header which is outlined in the next section.

### Authentication

All requests to the Settlement Report require authentication in the form of an
`Authorization` header.  This header contains the value `Passcode <YOUR API
ACCESS PASSCODE>` which is an encoded version of your merchant ID and your
Reporting API Access Passcode.  Note that your Reporting API Access Passcode can
be found in the [Member Area](https://web.na.bambora.com) under
**administration**, **account setttings**, and then **order settings**).

`<YOUR API ACCESS PASSCODE>` is created by concatenating your merchant id to
your Reporting API Access Passcode (separated by a colon), and then base 64
encoding the result.

As an example, if your merchant ID is 123456789, and your reporting API passcode
is `fd36d245a3584434b904096525547f17`, then using Javascript your API access
passcode could be generated by doing:

```javascript
merchantID = "123456789";
reportingAPIPasscode = "fd36d245a3584434b904096525547f17";

// base 64 encode the two values concatenated with a colon
yourAPIAccessPassCode = btoa(merchantID + ":" + reportingAPIPasscode);
```

In this example `yourAPIAccessPassCode` would be
`MTIzNDU2Nzg5OmZkMzZkMjQ1YTM1ODQ0MzRiOTA0MDk2NTI1NTQ3ZjE3` which is the value
used when making a call to the Settlement Report API.

Alternatively, for convenience, you can also use the form at
<https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/forms/encode_api_passcode/> which does the
same calculation.

It is worth noting that while this process obfuscates/obscures your reporting
API passcode it is not an *encrypted* value, so this value should be treated with
equal sensitivity/security as your reporting API passcode itself.

### Parameters

The Settlement report accepts two parameters to control the data returned by
the endpoint: `start_date` and `end_date`, both of which are supplied as query
string parameters on the HTTP `GET` request.  Both dates are specified in the
`YYYY-MM-DD` format (including leading zeros, so for example, January 1st, 2021
would be specified as `2021-01-01`).

```no-highlight
Note: Both of these values are required on all requests to the Settlement Report API
```

Both parameters accept a date, and will restrict settlement records to the date
range specified (inclusive).  More details are in the formal specification at
<https://dev.na.bambora.com/docs/references/payment_APIs/v1-0-5/>

### Example

An example request is illustrated below.

#### Request

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/reports/settlement?start_date=2020-12-01&end_date=2021-01-31' \
--header 'Authorization: Passcode <YOUR API ACCESS PASSCODE>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Replace `<YOUR API ACCESS PASSCODE>` with your API passcode.

```javascript
